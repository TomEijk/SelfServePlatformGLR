> Establishing the Data Mesh Ecosystem
Platform ecosystems — made famous by Uber and AirBnB — are transforming industries. How can a platform ecosystems approach be applied to transform your enterprise Data Mesh?

> Platforms Ecosystems are Transforming Industries
A famous article published in 2016 in Harvard Business Review explained how a new “platform ecosystem” approach was about to transform industries. The author’s key insight was that older style “pipeline” companies — those that created products and sold them to customers — would be replaced by “platforms”. These so-called Platforms would make it safe and reliable for a community of “consumers” and “producers” to find each other, to interact, and to transact. And by bringing together consumers and producers they predicted that growth would explode: as more customers used the platform, it attracted more producers, and as more producers came on-board and offered new and innovative products, it attracted more consumers, and on and on, as a virtual circle of network effects took hold.
And, as history shows, they were right. In transportation, Uber matches “consumers” that want rides to “producers” that offer rides. In lodging, AirBnB matches “consumers” that want accommodations with “producers” that want to rent their places. And transportation and lodging, and many other industries, have never been the same!
So, why should Data Mesh professionals care? Simply put, because a Platform Ecosystem approach transforms how Data Mesh is implemented. This article makes the case that Data Mesh principles — domain ownership, data as a product, self-serve infrastructure, and federated governance — strongly encourage a “Platform Ecosystem” approach inside the enterprise. In fact, I will argue that combining Platform Ecosystem approach with Data Mesh is so profound that it will transform the way enterprises create and execute their data strategies.
This article assumes that you have a high-level understanding of Data Mesh. If you need some background information on Data Mesh, here are a few links to a great articles for Data Mesh principles , architecture, and patterns.

> Platforms Let Producers and Consumers Interact and Transact
What is a platform?
First, Platforms are about creating ecosystems (“Platform Ecosystems”). According to the landmark HBR article, there are several participants in the Platform Ecosystem: Owners of platforms control their intellectual property and provide standards, protocols, and governance; Producers create their offerings; Consumers use those offerings; and, Providers create the infrastructure that bring Producers together with Consumers.
But interestingly, the ability to bring producers and consumers together creates network effects. As more consumers join a platform, more producers create new and innovative apps, and with more apps, more consumers join, and on and on. A virtuous cycle borne of network effects takes hold!
Perhaps a few examples will make this clear. Let’s take a look at Uber, the well-known ride sharing company. In Uber, people that offer rides are producers. People that want a ride are consumers. Uber is the owner and provider of the platform — it creates and manages the infrastructure and apps that allows consumers and producers to find each other, and to safely interact and transact to get rides. As Andrew Chen describes his journey with Uber in his recent book, “The Cold Start Problem”, once Uber got a critical mass of drivers (producers) and folks wanting rides (consumers) in a particular city, network effects took over and Uber within a short period dominated ride-sharing.
Now, let’s look at AirBnB the famous accommodations and lodging rental firm. In AirBnB, people that want to offer accommodations for rent are producers. People that want to rent accommodations are consumers. AirBnB is the owner and provider of the platform and creates and manages the infrastructure and app that allows consumers and producers to find each other, and to safely interact and transact and get a place. Similar to Uber, in his book Andrew Chen also describes the growth of AirBnB and points out that once they had sufficient rental units, customers and producers flocked to AirBnB and network effects once again created an industry giant.

> Data Products are Natural Platforms
So, how does this apply to Data Mesh? Well, I suppose in several ways.
First, like Platforms, a Data Product has an owner. And that Data Product owner is responsible for establishing the mechanisms for allowing data producers and data consumers to interact and transact safely and reliably. Where a Platform such as AirBnB or Uber provides infrastructure and apps, a Data Product owner provides the infrastructure as well as mechanisms to permit data producers and data consumers to interact (using APIs to access data and Data Product Catalogs to find data and consume).
Second, Data Products — a core concept in Data Mesh — embody the notion of consumers and producers. Every Data Product owns and produces data, and every Data Product has groups that consume data.
Third, as each producer creates new data (or updates existing data) the value of the Data Product increases. And with more data or better data, consumers get more value from Data Product.
Last, with more value, comes demand, which drives additional funding (typically via new projects), which drives producers to create more new and better data. And the virtuous circle of network effects have an opportunity to take hold.

> One last but important point. It may be natural to confuse a Platform Ecosystem approach with traditional IT shared services. So, I say this emphatically: Platform Ecosystem are not shared services!
Platform Ecosystems bring producers and consumers together and hence focus on resource orchestration, whereas shared services try to bring together scarce resources and act as a mechanism for resource control. Platform Ecosystems focus on optimizing the interactions between a community of producers and consumers, whereas shared services focus on optimizing internal processes. Platform Ecosystems focus on agility, whereas shared services focus on cost efficiencies.

> Data Mesh Creates Natural Ecosystems
A Platform such as Uber or AirBnB creates a community. The interactions of the participants in a community create an ecosystem. And when an ecosystem has reached critical mass, network effects take hold and value grows exponentially.
In this sense, a Data Mesh is a natural ecosystem. An enterprise Data Mesh fosters many communities, each composed of many Data Products and their own individual community. So, while each Data Product community creates value when individual Data Products begin to share data with other Data Products, even more value is created. And as data producers and consumers continuously interact, the wonderful network effects of the Data Mesh (and its Data Products) grow following a predictable pattern (figure 3, below):
Data producers create data.
Data consumers user data, but number of data consumers grows as more or better data is produced.
Network effects take hold as the number of consumers and demand for data increases, which drives an increase in funding (via newly funded projects, for example) that, in turn, create new data producers, and on and on.
The value of enterprise data increases exponentially as network effects take hold (back to step 1, rinse and repeat).

> A Platform Ecosystem approach is true to the core Data Mesh principles:
Data is a Product: Data Products provide clear boundaries for data product services and Platform provide boundaries for platform services. Each has an ecosystem of producers and consumers that together interact to consume and derive value.
Self-serve: A Platform Ecosystem approach fosters self-serve by incentivizing Data Product owners to make it easy for data producers and consumers to consume data. In Uber and AirBnB’s case, for example, they created apps (for both producers and consumers) that make it easy to find each other, interact, and transact. Data Product Catalogs (and their Enterprise Data Product Catalog cousins) and APIs foster a self-serve capability by make it easy to find data and consume data.
Decentralized Domain Ownership: Data Products boundaries provide clear delineation and accountability for ownership and service provision. A Platform Ecosystem approach, similarly, has clear boundaries and accountability for owners and providers.
Federated Governance: In an external Platform Ecosystem such as Uber or AirBnB, governance is completely federated as each business must vouch for its own financials and abide with laws and regulations established by government. Like a Platform Ecosystem approach, Data Product decisions are made by Data Product owners who are empowered to make decisions in the best interests of their data producers and consumers while abiding with enterprise rules and processes (for example, technology standards, etc).

> Data Mesh and Platforms Create New Rules for Enterprise Data Strategy
The introduction of a Platform Ecosystem approach provides a new way to establish an enterprise Data Mesh. But this approach has fundamental technology, governance, and organizational implications that require a re-thinking of the rules for an enterprise data strategy:
Shared Services IT become Federated Platforms: Today, IT shared services make technology decisions and are responsible for data management. In a Platform Ecosystem, owners (in our case Data Product owners) are responsible for selecting and implementing their own platform capabilities, while adopting enterprise standards where it makes sense and at their discretion.
Agility replaces Cost Optimization: Today, IT (especially with shared services model) optimizes for cost. In contrast, a Platform Ecosystem approach values agility, which is facilitated by giving Data Product owners — those most knowledgeable about their data’s value — the ability to prioritize funding and activities based upon the needs of their data producers and consumers.
Centralization vs Conway’s Law: Conway’s Law suggests (paraphrased) that systems and data follow organizational structure. Today, IT is typically organized in centralized services (contrary to Conway’s Law). Rather, a Platforms and Ecosystems approach allows Data Products to be owned by those closest and most knowledgeable about data which typically are business units.
User Value to Ecosystem Value: Today, users try to maximize the value of their silo of data, and unfortunately extending beyond this is a painful and costly exercise (see previous points). On the other hand, a Platform Ecosystem approach seeks to maximize the value of the ecosystem of producers and consumers as they consume and exchange data. This approach establishes producers and consumers as first-class citizens. And the interaction of producers and consumers with a single Data Product, and then extended to many Data Products in an enterprise Data Mesh creates a thriving ecosystem, which when operating well, creates a virtuous cycle of exponential growth and value realization as network effects take hold.

> Concluding Thoughts
Clearly, Data Mesh offers new opportunities in how we manage and realize value from enterprise data. But the organizational, technology, and governance implications create significant challenges in implementing Data Mesh in tooday’s traditional centralized IT shared services.
These challenges can be address through a Platform Ecosystem approach that implements Data Mesh “ownership” principles giving Data Product owners clear accountability for decision making, that implements federated governance from the ground-up using “platforms”, that allows owners to establish self-serve capabilities in a manner that best serves their data producers and consumers, that exponentially magnifies the value of data (and creates new funding mechanisms) through a virtuous cycle of data production and consumption as network effects take hold as inside the enterprise.
So, as you embark upon your enterprise data strategy, remember that a Platform Ecosystem approach provides a practical, feasible — and natural — way to address the fundamental organization, technology, and governance challenges of Data Mesh.
