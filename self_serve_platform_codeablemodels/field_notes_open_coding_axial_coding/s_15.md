> Data Mesh essentially refers to the concept of breaking down data lakes and siloes into smaller, more decentralized portions. Much like the shift from monolithic applications toward microservices architectures in the world of software development, Data Mesh can be described as a data-centric version of microservices.
The term was first defined by ThoughtWorks consultant Zhamak Dehghani as a type of data platform architecture that is designed to embrace the all-pervasive nature of data in enterprises through its self-serve, domain-oriented structure.
As a novel organizational and architectural concept, Data Mesh challenges the traditional perspective that big data must be centralized to leverage its analytical potential. That unless all data is stored in one place and managed centrally, it cannot deliver its true value. In a 180-degree departure from that age-old assumption, Data Mesh claims that big data can fuel innovation only and only when it’s disbursed among owners of domain data, who then provide data-as-a-product.
To facilitate this, a new version of federated governance must be adopted through automation for the sake of interoperability of domain-oriented data products. The democratization of data is the key premise on which the concept of Data Mesh rests, and it cannot be achieved without decentralization, interoperability, and prioritizing the data consumers’ experience.
As an architectural paradigm, Data Mesh holds immense promise in powering analytics at scale by rapidly providing access to fast-growing distributed domain sets. Particularly, in the case of consumption proliferation scenarios such as analytics, machine learning, or development and deployment of data-centric applications.
At its core, Data Mesh seeks to address the shortcomings associated with traditional platform architecture that resulted in the creation of centralized data lakes or warehouses. In sharp contrast to monolithic infrastructures for data handling where the consumption, storage, processing, and output of data is limited to a central data lake, a Data Mesh supports the distribution of data into specific domains. The data-as-a-product approach allows owners of different domains to handle their own data pipelines independently.
The tissues interlinking these domains and the data assets associated with them serve as a layer of interoperability that maintains a uniform standard of syntax and data. In essence, different pockets of data are interwoven and held together by a mesh. Hence, the name.

> Self-serve data infrastructure as a platform: Building, deploying, accessing, and monitoring data-as-a-product requires extensive infrastructure and skills to provision it. Replicating these resources for every domain created under the Data Mesh approach would be unfeasible. More importantly, different domains can require access to the same set of data. To eliminate duplication of efforts and resources, a high-level abstraction of infrastructure. That’s where the principle of self-serve data infrastructure as a platform comes into play. This is essentially an extension of the existing delivery platforms needed to run and monitor different services. A self-serve data platform comprises tools capable of supporting domain developer’s workflow with minimal specialized skill and know-how. At the same time, it must be capable of reducing costs of building data products.
