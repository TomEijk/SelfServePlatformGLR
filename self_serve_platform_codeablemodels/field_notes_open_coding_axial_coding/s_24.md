> How we scale our data platform efficiently and reliably

> Integrating Analytics Engineers into all cross-functional teams: a key success factor to scale a data platform efficiently and reliably

> Nubank is one of the world’s largest digital banks with 35M customers in Latin America as of April 2021. Its products range from credit cards and loans to bank accounts and life insurance. Data is an inherent part of every decision: we use it for analytics, monitoring, automation and product personalization.
As the company grew, we kept evolving our data organization to meet its needs. First, creating a central team to build the data infrastructure. Second, decentralizing the creation and consumption of data to users in cross-functional teams (squads). Third, increasing the central team’s scope and staffing to provide company-wide tools and standards.
As a self-service platform, the data ownership was spread out in all business units (BUs); however it wasn’t clear who was accountable for maintenance and applying those new standards. 
Yet, maintaining quality data was key for all the products and reporting depending on it, as well as for the efficiency of teams consuming that data on a daily basis.
We needed to solve that challenge: how can we make sure our organization structure reflects the company’s data goals of agility and quality?

> In this article, we’ll share with you:
1 – The governance challenges of a self-service data platform
2 – Designing a hybrid organization to scale innovation with quality guarantees
3 – Implementation and impact

> Part 1 : The governance challenges of a self-service data platform

> Quality controls vs. low-friction

> The goal of a data platform is to foster innovation with a user-friendly and efficient way to find, use, add and create data.
It needs to do so while limiting any risk that could come from data, whether that’s the quality of the contributions and meta data, the security and protection of any personal and confidential data, the integrity of the data processing or the processing costs.
In our platform, we decided to provide a very low friction experience to add tables to our data pipelines. This resulted in many tables created – in April 2021, we had 35K non-raw tables created by 500 contributors across the company’s squads – and many opportunities seized thanks to this data. 
However, while we didn’t want to impose strict quality rules to all contributions, we did expect the key data to apply our high-quality standards and tools, to control risks and improve data consumers efficiency.
The main complexity lay in defining and assigning those quality responsibilities to reach our goals, without creating unnecessary bureaucracy.

> Data quality ownership

> As explained in a previous article, the data platform team successfully kicked off a data quality initiative by creating a layer of quality data (“core datasets”), new libraries to structure the code and the documentation, and tools to get alerted on quality checks anomalies. 
To launch by example, the central team created the first “core datasets” – half a year later, 75% of all datasets were using those high-quality datasets. However, it aimed to focus on the platform tooling and hand over the ownership of high-quality datasets to the business units.
The Data BU did not have the domain expertise nor the capacity to curate and maintain all the key datasets, while most cross-functional BUs focused on new applications and analysis for their products rather than engaging in data quality actions.
We had to make sure the responsibility for data quality implementation would not fall into the cracks of the organization.

> Data impact awareness

> As the platform was self-service, most teams were owning some tables, created most frequently by analysts and data scientists. However, teams did not necessarily realize the impact their data could have on others; how much they were dependent on other teams’ datasets; or how much time was spent on data crunching.
We understood we needed to provide more visibility on the responsibilities and risks at stake when creating or using a dataset.
We created a data governance visibility dashboard that showed for each team or business unit, the main metrics for data inventory and the main interdependencies they had up and downstream.
We also gave recommendations on what to do: what are the datasets you should maintain, create, review, add documentation to, etc. Moreover, we ran surveys to show the increasingly high time spent on finding data as the data inventory grew in terms of volume and complexity.
As the importance of data became more measurable and visible, it became clearer that we needed an accountable team to implement those data governance recommendations and design a coherent data strategy with each business unit.
