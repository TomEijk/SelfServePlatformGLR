> Defining The Data Mesh:
i) A decentralised architecture, whereby each data source is its own domain with a data owner. Each domain is the building block and is discoverable, addressable, self-describing and governed by global access control. Each domain stores data in a lake and occasionally a relational store too
ii) Infrastructure is served as a platform providing
Storage
Pipelines
Data catalogue
Access control
Avoiding duplication between domains

> Self-Service data infrastructure as a platform
Providing high-level abstraction of infrastructure to allow easy provision and management of data products.
To allow self-service, each of the domain teams needs to run their own data products autonomously.
A self-service data platform must provide:
Access to polyglot data storage
Data products schema
Data pipeline declaration and orchestration
Data products compute and locality
The self-serve platform has different planes serving different types of users:
a) Data infrastructure provision
Required to run components of a data product and the mesh of products
Distributed file storage account
Access control
Orchestration to run data products internal code
b) Data product developer experience
Main interface, a data product developer, uses a higher level of abstraction than the provision
Simple declarative interfaces to manage a product's lifecycle
Implements cross-cutting concerns
c) Data mesh supervision plane
An interface allowing us to see a graph of connected data products globally
For example, the ability to discover data products is best provided by browsing through the data mesh
