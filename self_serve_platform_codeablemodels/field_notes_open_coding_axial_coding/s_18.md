> The Google Technology Landscape for a Self-Service Data Platform

> For organizations running on Google Cloud, what native managed services are available for building a self-service data platform? This post answers that question.

> One of the key goals of data platform modernization is to make data self-service for both technical users (data scientists, analysts) as well as business users (marketers, product managers).  Cloud technologies are evolving rapidly to provide building blocks that automate and simplify the tasks in the data user's journey map from raw data to insights.

> I recommend familizing with the data user's journey map from my previous post on the evolving data landscape. This (relatively short) post builds on that journey map framework and highlights the relevant Google technologies. It is impressive to see the breadth of data technologies Google has developed.
