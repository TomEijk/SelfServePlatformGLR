> Rethinking the API Platform

> The market demands that API delivery be fast and nimble. “Platform” thinking — used by Uber and AirBnB — can be applied to decentralize and democratize API delivery inside the enterprise to drive new levels of agility, speed, and efficiency.

> Enterprise Platforms can Transform API Delivery
APIs are foundational to enterprise modernization efforts. They connect internal applications, partners and clients while providing the building blocks required to bring new products, releases, and capabilities to market faster.
But today’s centralized API delivery organizations are slow and bureaucratic that hinder agility, reduce speed, and increase costs.
Increasingly enterprises are turning to Platforms to provide the infrastructure and rules for a marketplace that brings together producers and consumers and transform API delivery.
This article will explain how to Platforms can be applied to decentralize and democratize API delivery to drive new levels of agility, speed, and efficiency.

> The Centralized API Delivery Model is not Working
The promise of APIs has not been delivered in most enterprises. McKinsey, a large global consulting firm, states “in many cases, a rush to build APIs without a thoughtful strategy has created a mess, with redundancies, poor maintenance practices, and limited transparency canceling out many of the potential benefits.”
McKinsey, continues “in many cases, a rush to build APIs without a thoughtful strategy has created a mess, with redundancies, poor maintenance practices, and limited transparency canceling out many of the potential benefits.” The result? Once again McKinsey writes “some companies have spent years ripping and replacing mega-systems, adding APIs in an ad hoc way the entire time, without making any real progress.” 
But enterprises started off with good intentions by created centralized API delivery organizations, mostly as a way to aggregate hard-to-find talent. In this case, the centralized API development team is responsible for the end-to-end API delivery lifecycle, from specification definition to development to deployment and operations.
But there are challenges with this centralized API delivery model. First, the centralized API team is structured as shared service delivery model which, by definition, is a monopoly. Since there is no alternative source of APIs other than the centralized API team. And with no alternatives, consumers — developers in business units, for example — have little choice but to take what is offered.
Second, this centralized API monopoly introduces bureaucracy that insulates the centralized API delivery team from critical feedback required to respond in an agile fashion. And as importantly, this bureaucracy separates the shared services from the give-and-take with consumers that drives innovation.
Lastly, the shared service monopoly formalizes bureaucracy — to near ubiquitous “intake” processes, for example — leads to governance, or the “rules of engagement”, that are designed for cost efficiency rather than speed, stability rather than agility, repeatability rather than flexibility.
Clearly, today’s centralized API delivery model is an old relic, unable to respond to today’s rapidly changing technology landscape, dynamic market, and demanding consumers.
This is where “Platforms” come in. But in most cases, they are referring to companies and external ecosystems. But the key concept of “Platforms” can be applied inside a company as well to create “Enterprise Platforms” that are proving to radically transform API delivery.

> Enterprise Platforms Create Ecosystems Inside the Enterprise
Enterprise Platforms apply the “Platform” concepts but to an internal audience rather than an external audience.

> In fact, Enterprise Platforms have nearly identical characteristics to their external-facing Platform cousins. First, Enterprise Platforms have Producers that still create offerings, Consumers that still buy offerings, and Platforms that still provide the infrastructure and safety that make it easy to connect Producers with Consumers, provide feedback between them, and make it safe for them to interact and transact.
Second, like their external Platform cousins, Enterprise Platforms have multiple internal Producers avoiding any monopoly provider situations. And multiple Producers create competition that give choice to Consumers.
Third, Enterprise Platform provide internal tools and utilities (like internal “Marketplaces”) that make it easy for Producers to interact and transact (consume services) with Consumers.
Lastly, Enterprise Platforms also create a light-weight automated governance processes that establish “rules of engagement” while making it easy to verify compliance to common enterprise concerns such as re-use, security, operability, and observability.

> Enterprise API Platforms Transform API Delivery
Enterprise API Platforms are, quite simply, Enterprise Platforms designed to deliver APIs. Producers are developers that create APIs. Consumers are developers to use APIs created by Producers. And API Platforms are the infrastructure and guardrails that allow Producers and Consumers to find APIs and interact with each other to deliver APIs.

> Now, let’s come back to the traditional centralized API delivery model. More specifically, what changes, and what benefits are provided when Enterprise API Platforms replace these centralized API delivery models?
First, Enterprise API Platforms provide the capabilities such that any Producer in any business group can create APIs on their schedule, with any team, at any scale, based upon their specific requirements. Effectively, the centralized API delivery “monopoly” is replaced with multiple Producers, each of which are closer to their consumers, leading to vast improvements in agility and responsiveness.
Second, competition arises with multiple Producers giving consumers choice, leading to flexibility and speed.
Third, with tools such as “Marketplaces” and social features (“Likes”), Enterprise API Platforms replace cumbersome centralized API delivery model interaction mechanisms with vibrant feedback mechanisms, contributing to innovation.
Lastly, by making Producer-Consumer interactions, transactions, and governance safe and reliable, Enterprise API Platforms encourage and accelerate the formalization of API standards (OpenAPI specifications and standards, for example) as well as common enterprise concerns such as security, operability, and observability through explicit contracts, implementations (common components), and automated DEVOPS processes. This leads to delivery efficiencies and effectiveness.
Enterprise API Platforms truly transform API delivery and offer a compelling, practical, and effective alternative to the older centralized API delivery model.

> Establishing an Enterprise API Platform
So, what is an Enterprise API “Platform”?
First, and perhaps obviously, it provides the infrastructure that makes it safe and easy to build APIs. The API Platform provide prefabricated cross-cutting concerns, or “guardrails” required by enterprise-grade APIs. These guardrails are composed of the tools, utilities, and standards that implement libraries that implement cross-cutting concerns common to all APIs including security (OAUTH2, JWT, TLS), operability (logging, alerts), and observability (traces, monitoring, health).
Second, Enterprise API Platforms offer outstanding developer experiences. Developers buy into the API Platform since capabilities are transparent, effective, ambient, and “free” — they are available out of the box from an API/microservices framework — and require little to no effort by developers to consume. They have new tools such as “Marketplaces” that make it easy to find and consume APIs.
In addition, Enterprise API Platforms provides “social” indicators, such as “likes” and usage profiles, that create virtuous circular feedback loops between API producers and API consumers required to rapidly improve APIs and drive innovation.
API Platforms have “accelerators” that drive developer (producer) productivity such as multi-language support (for example, via sophisticated use of microservice proxies), infrastructure-as-code templates making packaging and deployment simpler.
Lastly, Platforms provide the “rules of engagement”, or governance, that make it easy to comply to enterprise standards. Prefabricated cross-cutting concerns ensure that developer build compliant APIs. Marketplaces make it easy to find documentation to ensure APIs are consumed properly. And instrumented and automated DEVOPS processes allow APIs that meet enterprise standards to be automatically “certified” bypassing traditional manual governance meetings and reviews.
API Platform governance processes address two distinct but related needs: Platform evolution and Platform consumption. Platform evolution is controlled by an engaged stakeholder group that takes clear accountability for nurturing — and funding — of the API Platform and its evolution ensuring the right capabilities and guardrails are established. This group also ensures that features built for the Platform are clearly linked to achieving business outcomes. Platform consumption by developers is governed by a group that has an enterprise mandate such as enterprise architecture, to ensure that APIs are not just built correctly but that re-use is encouraged where appropriate.
And since our Enterprise API Platform encourages widely federated development (many “producers”), it should be matched by a federated API governance model: each project, group, region business group, and lastly the “enterprise” should be able to certify that their APIs are being built correctly, and as importantly, call out exceptions where deviations from Platform standards or Guardrails are identified (for example, when an API is not addressing cross-cutting concerns), or when an API is not addressing business functionality in an effective manner (for example, re-use opportunities are not considered).

> Concluding Thoughts
The real promise of Enterprise API Platforms is that they give enterprises the freedom to drive the innovation, speed, and agility demanded by today’s market. They permit a truly federated API delivery model that is not constrained by bureaucratic processes but instead allows any enterprise team, at any time, to build the APIs demanded by their project, group, or line of business. Older centralized API delivery models are just that. Old. Their time has passed. Enterprise API Platforms really are the better way.
