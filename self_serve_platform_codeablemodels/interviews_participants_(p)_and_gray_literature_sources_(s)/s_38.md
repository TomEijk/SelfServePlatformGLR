> Data Mesh: Making Climate Data Easy to Find, Use, and Share

> Accurate, available, and consistently interoperable climate data is crucial to addressing our global climate crisis. Here is how OS-Climate is using Data Mesh to make climate data easy to find, consume, share, and govern.

> OS-Climate is Tackling the Climate and ESG Data Challenge
OS-Climate (OS-C) is applying Open Source capabilities to help organizations effectively leverage ESG data. Using this data — in conjunction with Open Source analytical tools — businesses, financial institutions, government, and civil society can drive transparency and insights in the areas of Physical Risk & Resilience, Transition Analysis, and Portfolio Alignment with Net Zero and Adaptation goals. OS-C’s vision is to dramatically boost global capital flows into climate change mitigation and resilience.
OS-C’s mission is to help organizations determine if they are operating in, investing in, or partnering with companies that are aligned with Paris Accord Agreement goals and ESG values. And to do this, OS-C is building a technical foundation of open source tools to organize and make available climate and ESG data.
But there is a fundamental and insidious obstacle in the way: trustworthy climate ESG data is exceedingly difficult to find, consume, share, and govern.
To overcome this obstacle OS-C is on a journey to adopt “Data Mesh” principles with a goal of making ESG and climate data easier to find, consume, share, and govern.
This article describes OS-C’s data mesh journey.

> Trustworthy Climate Data is Hard to Find, Consume, Share, and Govern
ESG and climate data is the foundational enabler for OS-C. But this data is changing literally every moment, every day, every year:
Volume of ESG and climate data is exploding, as infrastructure is instrumented to capture emissions data, and as more and more firms choose to publish their emissions data.
Variability of ESG and climate data is growing exponentially, as more diverse data is made available.
Value of ESG and climate data is increasing dramatically, as regulators — as well as investors — demand access to this data.
And this situation is complicated by a fundamental challenge: ESG and climate data is hard to find, consume, share, and govern. ESG and Climate data is:
Distributed across literally thousands of data sources, making it hard to find.
Unstructured, making it hard to understand and consume.
Inconsistent, making it hard to share, compare, and aggregate.

> OS-C’s goal is to overcome these obstacles and make ESG and climate data easy to find, consume, share, and govern. To achieve this goal, OS-C is:
Creating an ecosystem of data products — also known as a data mesh — that makes ESG and Climate easy to find, understand, and trust.
Establishing a federated sourcing and governance model, aligned to Data Mesh principles, which combines public data, or “open” data which can be used by anyone, as well as private data which imposes custom contracts between climate data producers and consumers.
Engineering a “self-serve” data platform, aligned to Data Mesh principles, to unlock ESG and Climate data.

> OS-Climate: Establishing an Ecosystem of ESG/Climate Data Products
Data Mesh is now emerging as a modern approach to addressing large-scale data challenges for large enterprises. But the principles that make Data Mesh so valuable for enterprises also make it an ideal approach to addressing the data challenges OS-C and its ecosystem partners are tackling.
But what is a “Data Mesh”? First and foremost, there is the foundational book, Data Mesh, Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale, by Zhamak Dehghani. And there are a number of great articles available here (patterns), here (architecture), here (principles) and here (lessons learned) that will provide more detailed technical information about Data Mesh.
For our purposes, we will define Data Mesh as an ecosystem of interacting “Data Products”. A data product is, simplistically, a way of treating data as a product. Each data product:
Has a clear boundary,
Participates in an ecosystem of producers and consumers,
Uses a platform to makes it easy to find, consume, share, and govern data,
Publishes meta data enabling self-service and discovery, and,
Adheres to a clear set of governance standards while respecting local autonomy.

![ClimateProducts](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*8IYKpdRNkpXIjdP4owGUrg.png)

> Our reasons for applying data mesh principles are based upon the following rationale.
First, applying Data Mesh principles will make ESG and climate data products easier to find, consume, share, and govern:
Data Mesh defines data domains — recognized boundaries and locations for trustworthy ESG and climate data — which provides a crucial first step in finding data in our highly distributed and diverse landscape of ESG and climate data.
Data Mesh identifies owners for data domains, which will empower individuals or groups to propose how to make data consumable.
Data Mesh implements a “self-serve” model, where access to data domains is through standard and consistent mechanisms (for example, via APIs or other common/Open methods) making it easy to share data within and between organizations.
Data Mesh offers a “federated” governance model, that gives data owners the local autonomy to respect regional needs and diverse regulatory demands most effectively while also making it easier federate the governance and trustworthiness of data.
Second, by applying these principles OS-C can establish an ecosystem of data products (also known as a Data Mesh), where each climate data product is discoverable, addressable, interoperable, self-describing, trustworthy, secure.
OS-Climate’s ESG and Climate data product ecosystem will implement Data Mesh capabilities using Open Source components, including:
A catalog of data that makes it easy to find data,
Common communication services that make it easy to access data,
Distributed “data products” that have clear boundaries and owners to enable rapid decision making, and,
APIs in each Data Product that make it easy to access and share data.

![OS-C](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*p8-D4lR5fXg6hq_7z0BA8Q.png)

> With these data mesh capabilities, data products will make ESG and Climate data easier to find, consume, share, and govern, which will lead to better and faster insights, improved time-to-market for availability of ESG and Climate data, reduced cost and overhead of making ESG and Climate data available and accessible.

> OS-Climate: Establishing a Federated Sourcing Model
In keeping with Data Mesh federated governance principles, OS-C is establishing a “federated sourcing” model which combines public data, or “open” data which can be used by anyone, as well as private data which imposes custom contracts between climate data producers and consumers.

![Federated](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*2xcIQi4LVRUWt6_u1R1odA.png)

> OS-C’s federated sourcing model will strive to create “shared” data where we establish pre-emptive licenses for limited use, thereby making ESG and Climate data easier to consume and share. We foresee a “climate-data-as-a-service” capability which is by default open, but with clear licenses for access and use of closed data. This approach is modelled upon the practices established by IB1 (Icebreaker 1).

> OS-Climate: Creating a Self-Serve ESG and Climate Platform
OS-C is establishing a “self-serve” platform that will make ESG and Climate data easy to find, consume, and share.

![Self-serve](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*V5f_Yjt-4MujjEnSnRa6Ng.png)

> OS-Climate foresees an ecosystem of open source products offering “model to microservice” capabilities spanning a variety of key constituencies including business leaders, data scientists, developers, and operations staff. Popular open source tools are integrated into OS-C’s ESG and Climate Data Value Chain, including Spark, Kafka, Jupyter, Trino, and Prometheus, to name a few.
And OS-C’s goal is to make each element of the value chain structured as “self-serve” giving local autonomy and control to the global ESG and Climate data constituency.

![Fabric](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*r96ifzhz-cvvgHXYOxQ0Yw.png)

> To support these capabilities, OS-C will invest in an “ESG/Climate Data Product Factory” with repeatable templates and processes that will make it easy to build, secure, deploy, and manage data products.
It is important to note that OS-Climate is developing these data products as public goods, and these products are not designed to compete with data products of commercial data providers, rather to support commercial innovations by commercial providers such as those of OS-Climate members S&P Global and London Stock Exchange Group
