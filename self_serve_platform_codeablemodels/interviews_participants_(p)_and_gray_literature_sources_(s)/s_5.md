> Logical architecture: a multi-plane data platform

> The self-serve platform capabilities fall into multiple categories or planes as called in the model. Note: A plane is representative of a level of existence - integrated yet separate. Similar to physical and consciousness planes, or control and data planes in networking. A plane is neither a layer and nor implies a strong hierarchical access model.

![Platform](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles/platform-notation.png)

> A self-serve platform can have multiple planes that each serve a different profile of users. In the following example, lists three different data platform planes:

> Data infrastructure provisioning plane: supports the provisioning of the underlying infrastructure, required to run the components of a data product and the mesh of products. This includes provisioning of a distributed file storage, storage accounts, access control management system, the orchestration to run data products internal code, provisioning of a distributed query engine on a graph of data products, etc. I would expect that either other data platform planes or only advanced data product developers use this interface directly. This is a fairly low level data infrastructure lifecycle management plane.

    acces_control_management
```

> Data product developer experience plane: this is the main interface that a typical data product developer uses. This interface abstracts many of the complexities of what entails to support the workflow of a data product developer. It provides a higher level of abstraction than the 'provisioning plane'. It uses simple declarative interfaces to manage the lifecycle of a data product. It automatically implements the cross-cutting concerns that are defined as a set of standards and global conventions, applied to all data products and their interfaces.

> Data mesh supervision plane: there are a set of capabilities that are best provided at the mesh level - a graph of connected data products - globally. While the implementation of each of these interfaces might rely on individual data products capabilities, itâ€™s more convenient to provide these capabilities at the level of the mesh. For example, ability to discover data products for a particular use case, is best provided by search or browsing the mesh of data products; or correlating multiple data products to create a higher order insight, is best provided through execution of a data semantic query that can operate across multiple data products on the mesh.

> The following model is only exemplary and is not intending to be complete. While a hierarchy of planes is desirable, there is no strict layering implied below.
